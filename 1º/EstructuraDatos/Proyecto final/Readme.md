FINAL PROYECT

ok so our project is a game that has an inicial level with a problem, after solving this problem, which can be a quiz, math problem, logic question or a computation problem, after solving this problem, other levels are unlocked, and the player can choose which route wants to keep pushing on.

So now we need to:
create an story which is going to be progressively showing after each level completed, and after finishing the game, the user needs to solve the story main problem to finish the game and the game finishes
the project needs to be a graph and have a linked list
the project needs to have a library .cpp and .h in which the functions are going to be declared and the main.cpp where the functionality of the project is gonna be declared
