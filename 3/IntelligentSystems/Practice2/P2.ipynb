    "\n",
    "The **Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)** involves a salesperson who wants to sell a product and, to do so, needs to find the **shortest possible route** through the cities of their customers, visiting each city only once and **starting and ending** the journey in their own city (a circular route from the initial city).\n",
    "\n",

    "- \\( N \\) is the set of **\\( n = |N| \\) nodes** (cities).\n",
    "- \\( A \\) is the set of **edges** connecting the nodes.\n",
    "- Each edge \\( (i, j) in A \\) has an associated weight \\( d_ij \\), which represents the **distance** between cities \\( i \\) and \\( j \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **TSP reduces to the problem of finding the minimum-length Hamiltonian circuit** in the graph \\( G \\). A solution to a TSP instance can be represented as a **permutation of city indices**, where the **order of visits** determines the **total travel cost** in terms of the total distance covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are **\\( n! \\) possible permutations**, the problem belongs to the **NP category**, making it computationally expensive to solve as \\( n \\) increases. This means that solving instances with a large number of cities (**large \\( n \\)**) is impractical using **uninformed search strategies**. Instead, the problem can **benefit from metaheuristics**, allowing larger instances to be tackled while still obtaining **reasonably good solutions** within a feasible time.\n"

    "# P2.1: Basic Implementation of Tabu Search\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you must develop a **basic version** of the **Tabu Search** algorithm to solve the **Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)** applied to the municipalities of Galicia. The specification of the algorithm will be highly detailed since the main objective of this first part is to ensure you have a **fully functional and verified implementation** that correctly solves the problem. As in **P1**, we assume that the **tour is circular** (starting and ending at the same municipality) and must include **N = 100** municipalities in Galicia.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the algorithm, **review the algorithmic description** of the metaheuristic covered in the lecture (**See T1, slide 49 and related slides**).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Considerations for the Basic Implementation\n",
    "- **Solution Representation:** The solution is represented as an **ordered sequence (permutation)** **starting and ending at city 0**. That is, we use an ordered representation consisting of a sequence of numerical values representing each municipality **{0, 1, ..., 99}**. The starting and ending point is always **municipality 0**, so a valid solution **S** is represented as a permutation of the remaining values **{1, ..., 99}**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial Solution:** A **completely random** permutation of the cities is generated as described in previous sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Neighborhood Generation Operator:** The **swap operator** is used to generate new neighboring solutions. The maximum number of different neighbors that can be generated from a given solution (all possible swaps) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\sum_{i=1}^{L-1}i = \\frac{L(L-1)}{2}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  Where **L** is the length of the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cost Function:** The total travel cost is computed as the **sum of the distances** in the tour while ensuring that the solution **starts and ends at city 0**. The distance is calculated based on the following three elements:\n",
    "    - **Distance from city 0 to the first city in the solution:** `0 -> S[0]`\n",
    "    - **Total distance traveled in the solution:** `S[0] -> S[1] -> ... -> S[-1]`\n",
    "    - **Distance from the final city back to city 0:** `S[-1] -> 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tabu List:** The **Tabu List (TL)** consists of **swap moves** `{i, j}` that generate the solutions forming the search trajectory. You must set **N = 100** as the **tabu tenure** parameter, meaning that the **tabu list will store N elements**. A move `{i, j}` will exit the tabu list after **N = 100** operations, making it permissible again.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reinitialization Strategy:** If **100 consecutive iterations** pass without improving the best solution **\\( S_{opt} \\)** found so far, a **restart** is triggered from **\\( S_{opt} \\)**. This serves as an **intensification strategy**.  \n",
    "  - The **tabu list is NOT reset** during reinitialization, allowing the exploration of previously unvisited neighbors due to prohibited swaps.\n",
    "  - When restarting, the algorithm returns to **\\( S_{opt} \\)** and clears the tabu list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stopping Criterion:** The algorithm terminates after **10,000 iterations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Verification of Your Implementation**\n",
    "To verify your implementation, **you must use** the **100-city Galician dataset** (`grafo100cidades.txt`).  \n",
    "As an initial test to ensure the implementation works correctly, you can use the **8-city Galician dataset** (`grafo8cidades.txt`). The **optimal solution** found using an **informed search** such as **A*** is approximately **382 km**.\n"
