    "\n",
    "The **Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)** involves a salesperson who wants to sell a product and, to do so, needs to find the **shortest possible route** through the cities of their customers, visiting each city only once and **starting and ending** the journey in their own city (a circular route from the initial city).\n",
    "\n",

    "- \\( N \\) is the set of **\\( n = |N| \\) nodes** (cities).\n",
    "- \\( A \\) is the set of **edges** connecting the nodes.\n",

    "The **TSP reduces to the problem of finding the minimum-length Hamiltonian circuit** in the graph \\( G \\). A solution to a TSP instance can be represented as a **permutation of city indices**, where the **order of visits** determines the **total travel cost** in terms of the total distance covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are **\\( n! \\) possible permutations**, the problem belongs to the **NP category**, making it computationally expensive to solve as \\( n \\) increases. This means that solving instances with a large number of cities (**large \\( n \\)**) is impractical using **uninformed search strategies**. Instead, the problem can **benefit from metaheuristics**, allowing larger instances to be tackled while still obtaining **reasonably good solutions** within a feasible time.\n"

    "# P2.1: Basic Implementation of Tabu Search\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you must develop a **basic version** of the **Tabu Search** algorithm to solve the **Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)** applied to the municipalities of Galicia. The specification of the algorithm will be highly detailed since the main objective of this first part is to ensure you have a **fully functional and verified implementation** that correctly solves the problem. As in **P1**, we assume that the **tour is circular** (starting and ending at the same municipality) and must include **N = 100** municipalities in Galicia.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the algorithm, **review the algorithmic description** of the metaheuristic covered in the lecture (**See T1, slide 49 and related slides**).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Considerations for the Basic Implementation\n",
    "- **Solution Representation:** The solution is represented as an **ordered sequence (permutation)** **starting and ending at city 0**. That is, we use an ordered representation consisting of a sequence of numerical values representing each municipality **{0, 1, ..., 99}**. The starting and ending point is always **municipality 0**, so a valid solution **S** is represented as a permutation of the remaining values **{1, ..., 99}**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial Solution:** A **completely random** permutation of the cities is generated as described in previous sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Neighborhood Generation Operator:** The **swap operator** is used to generate new neighboring solutions. The maximum number of different neighbors that can be generated from a given solution (all possible swaps) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\sum_{i=1}^{L-1}i = \\frac{L(L-1)}{2}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  Where **L** is the length of the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cost Function:** The total travel cost is computed as the **sum of the distances** in the tour while ensuring that the solution **starts and ends at city 0**. The distance is calculated based on the following three elements:\n",
    "    - **Distance from city 0 to the first city in the solution:** `0 -> S[0]`\n",
    "    - **Total distance traveled in the solution:** `S[0] -> S[1] -> ... -> S[-1]`\n",
    "    - **Distance from the final city back to city 0:** `S[-1] -> 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tabu List:** The **Tabu List (TL)** consists of **swap moves** `{i, j}` that generate the solutions forming the search trajectory. You must set **N = 100** as the **tabu tenure** parameter, meaning that the **tabu list will store N elements**. A move `{i, j}` will exit the tabu list after **N = 100** operations, making it permissible again.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reinitialization Strategy:** If **100 consecutive iterations** pass without improving the best solution **\\( S_{opt} \\)** found so far, a **restart** is triggered from **\\( S_{opt} \\)**. This serves as an **intensification strategy**.  \n",
    "  - The **tabu list is NOT reset** during reinitialization, allowing the exploration of previously unvisited neighbors due to prohibited swaps.\n",
    "  - When restarting, the algorithm returns to **\\( S_{opt} \\)** and clears the tabu list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stopping Criterion:** The algorithm terminates after **10,000 iterations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Verification of Your Implementation**\n",
    "To verify your implementation, **you must use** the **100-city Galician dataset** (`grafo100cidades.txt`).  \n",
    "As an initial test to ensure the implementation works correctly, you can use the **8-city Galician dataset** (`grafo8cidades.txt`). The **optimal solution** found using an **informed search** such as **A*** is approximately **382 km**.\n"

    "  - Restoring the tabu list.\n",
    "- **Diversification strategy using long-term memory**, such as:\n",
    "  - Implementing a **frequency matrix** (`frec`) that records the number of times each pair of cities appears consecutively in accepted solutions.\n",
    "  - Using this frequency matrix to perform a greedy initialization on a **modified distance matrix**, which **penalizes frequently visited pairs** by increasing their distance artificially:\n",

    "## Key Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Greedy Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhancement: Instead of starting from a random solution, we generate an initial solution using the nearest neighbor heuristic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation: A dedicated function, greedy_initial_solution, was created. Starting from city 0, the algorithm repeatedly selects the closest unvisited city until all cities are included in the tour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefit: This approach provides a higher-quality starting point, which reduces the time needed to escape poor initial configurations and leads to faster convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Frequency Matrix for Diversification\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhancement: A frequency matrix was introduced to record how often each pair of cities appears consecutively in accepted solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation: During each iteration, the matrix frequency is updated, and candidate moves are penalized if they involve transitions that have been used too frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefit: This mechanism discourages the repetition of the same moves, thereby promoting exploration of new regions in the search space and reducing the risk of getting trapped in local optima.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Improved Aspiration Criterion\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhancement: The algorithm allows moves that are normally tabu to be accepted if they yield a solution better than the best one found so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation: While evaluating neighbors, if a move is on the tabu list but produces a solution with a lower cost than the current best, it is accepted regardless of its tabu status.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefit: This adjustment prevents the algorithm from rejecting beneficial moves simply due to their tabu status, thus speeding up convergence toward high-quality solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strategic Restart\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhancement: A restart mechanism was implemented to overcome stagnation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation: If the algorithm goes a predetermined number of iterations (e.g., 100) without any improvement, it restarts from one of the best solutions found so far and clears the tabu list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefit: This strategy helps the search escape from stagnant regions in the solution space, thereby enhancing overall performance by exploring new, potentially more promising areas."

    "# Conclusions and Results\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating these enhancements into the Tabu Search algorithm, we observed the following benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Better Initial Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Greedy initialization provided a high-quality starting point, which reduced the exploration time required to improve the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enhanced Diversification:\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency matrix discouraged repetitive transitions, thereby preventing the algorithm from getting trapped in local optima and promoting broader search coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Faster Convergence:\n",
    "\n",
    "The improved aspiration criterion allowed promising moves to be accepted even if they were on the tabu list, resulting in faster progress toward optimal solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Escaping Stagnation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategic restart mechanism effectively re-diversified the search after periods of no improvement, leading to overall better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimental Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "After running multiple experiments (e.g., 10 runs on the US120 dataset), the enhanced algorithm showed a lower mean cost and reached high-quality solutions in fewer iterations on average. Execution times remained comparable while achieving superior solution quality. The statistical analysis (mean and standard deviation of best cost, iteration count, and execution time) confirmed the robustness of these improvements."
