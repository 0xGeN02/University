    "# Halving Game with Minimax Algorithm - Student Assignment\n",

    "\n",
    "The Halving Game is a two-player mathematical game with the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The game starts with a positive integer N\n",
    "- Players take turns making a move\n",
    "- On each turn, a player can either:\n",
    "  - Subtract 1 from the current number (`-` action)\n",
    "  - Divide the current number by 2, rounding down to an integer (`/` action)\n",
    "- The player who reduces the number to 0 **loses** the game\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if N=6:\n",
    "- Player 1 could subtract 1 (resulting in 5) or divide by 2 (resulting in 3)\n",
    "- If Player 1 chooses to subtract 1 (5), Player 2 could subtract 1 (4) or divide by 2 (2)\n",
    "- And so on until someone is forced to reduce the number to 0 and lose\n",

    "## 7. Assignment Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement the `recurse` function in the `minimaxPolicy` to create a perfect AI player for the Halving Game. The minimax algorithm should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explore all possible game states\n",
    "2. Evaluate terminal states using the utility function\n",
    "3. For non-terminal states, recursively determine the best action:\n",
    "   - For Player 1 (maximizing player), choose the action with the highest utility\n",
    "   - For Player 2 (minimizing player), choose the action with the lowest utility\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Example Minimax Trace\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you understand how minimax works in the Halving Game, here's a trace for a small example with N=3:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initial state: (+1, 3) - Player 1's turn, number is 3\n",
    "   * Player 1 has two options:\n",
    "     * Subtract 1: leads to (-1, 2)\n",
    "     * Divide by 2: leads to (-1, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For (-1, 2) - Player 2's turn, number is 2\n",
    "   * Player 2 has two options:\n",
    "     * Subtract 1: leads to (+1, 1)\n",
    "     * Divide by 2: leads to (+1, 1) (same as above, since 2//2 = 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For (+1, 1) - Player 1's turn, number is 1\n",
    "   * Player 1 has two options:\n",
    "     * Subtract 1: leads to (-1, 0) - Player 2 wins (utility = -∞)\n",
    "     * Divide by 2: leads to (-1, 0) - Player 2 wins (utility = -∞)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. For (-1, 1) - Player 2's turn, number is 1\n",
    "   * Player 2 has two options:\n",
    "     * Subtract 1: leads to (+1, 0) - Player 1 wins (utility = +∞)\n",
    "     * Divide by 2: leads to (+1, 0) - Player 1 wins (utility = +∞)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Working backwards:\n",
    "   * From (-1, 1), Player 2 will choose an action leading to (+1, 0), resulting in utility +∞\n",
    "   * From (+1, 1), Player 1 will choose an action leading to (-1, 0), resulting in utility -∞\n",
    "   * From (-1, 2), Player 2 will choose an action leading to (+1, 1), resulting in utility -∞\n",
    "   * From (+1, 3), Player 1 will choose an action leading to (-1, 1), resulting in utility +∞\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Therefore, from the initial state (+1, 3), Player 1's optimal move is to divide by 2 (leading to state (-1, 1)), which gives utility +∞, meaning Player 1 can force a win.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Testing Your Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "After implementing the minimax algorithm, test it by playing against it as Player 1. The AI should play perfectly, which means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For certain starting numbers (like N=15), the AI will always win with optimal play\n",
    "- For other starting numbers, you can win with optimal play\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to determine for which values of N the first player can force a win, and for which values the second player can force a win.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Extension Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've completed the basic minimax implementation, consider these extensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add time tracking to measure how long the algorithm takes to make decisions\n",
    "2. Implement alpha-beta pruning to improve efficiency\n",
    "3. Modify the game to allow additional actions (like multiplying by 3)\n",
    "4. Create a visualization of the game tree for small values of N\n",
    "5. Implement a depth-limited version of minimax with a heuristic evaluation function\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck!\n"
